The idea was simple but excitingâ€”I wanted to create a local AI assistant that anyone could interact with, even without an internet connection. By setting up the ESP8266 as a local server, I hosted a web-based chat interface that worked through a hotspot connection, allowing users to express themselves and engage with AI in real-time.
This project was a beginner-level experiment, but it opened doors to many enhancements and improvements I planned to add, like refining the UI, improving response accuracy, and expanding functionality. Through this experience, I gained valuable insights into networking, AI integration, and web development, and it fueled my passion for building practical, AI-powered solutions.
